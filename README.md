  client = UnifiController::Client.new(base_path: "https://127.0.0.1", port: 8443, username: 'your username or email', password: 'your password', verify_ssl: false)

  client.backup(days: -1) # Return backup file as a stream, no log backup
  client.backup(days: 60) # Return backup file as a stream, 60 days of logs

  # verify_ssl is used if the controller has SSL configured
```

### Endpoints

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
